# In this project, the goal is to make a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) model to predict the 2020 presidential election.# To build this model, first we focus on writing a dynamic scraping program that pulls in all of the current state polling data from RealClearPolitics. Then we use the state polling data to simulate 10,000 elections. The winner of each trial is determined by which candidate has the most electoral votes. We then use the results of the 10,000 trials to calculate the probability that each candidate will win the election. Finally, we use the probabilities to make a prediction for the 2020 presidential election.# Use the data to suggest and create visualizations that will help you understand the data and the model.
